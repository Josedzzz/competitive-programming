# Competitive Programming Solutions Repository

Welcome to the Competitive Programming Solutions Repository! This repository is dedicated to collecting solutions for various competitive programming problems encountered in tournaments and contests. Here, you'll find organized folders for different tournaments, each containing their respective problems and corresponding solutions.

## Repository Structure

- **Tournament Directories**: Each tournament has its own directory named after the tournament (e.g., `Tournament1`, `Tournament2`, etc.).
- **PDF Files**: Inside each tournament folder, you'll find a `problems.pdf` file that contains the problems presented during the tournament.
- **C++ Solution Files**: Each solution is provided in its own `.cpp` file. These files contain the code written to solve the respective problems.
